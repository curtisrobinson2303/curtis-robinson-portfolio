                Throughout my internship, I gained valuable experience and
                wisdom that have significantly contributed to my professional
                growth. I had the opportunity to optimize driver subroutines by
                implementing shippable Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
                subroutines across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISA).
                This enhanced my technical skills and deepened my understanding
                of software optimization and the complexities between low-level
                software and hardware. I also played a crucial role in ensuring
                reliability testing by developing C++/C test tools to analyze
                and debug issues with our SoftRAID application. This experience
                honed my programming fluency in C++, C, and Assembly Language as
                well as emphasized the importance of thorough testing in
                software development. In summary, my internship during the
                summer of 2023 provided me with a diverse skill set, including
                software optimization, programming, bug tracking, and debugging
                techniques providing invaluable experience for my career
                development in the field of computer engineering.

            <h1>Passive Filter Design</h1>
            <h2>
              During my advanced circuits class, I undertook a challenging
              passive filter design project that underscored my proficiency in
              circuit analysis and simulation using MATLAB. The project involved
              creating passive filters for specific applications, demonstrating
              my ability to navigate complex electrical circuits with precision.
              Through rigorous analysis and meticulous MATLAB simulations, I
              fine-tuned the filters to meet exacting requirements, showcasing
              my skills in both theoretical and practical aspects of electrical
              engineering. This project not only deepened my understanding of
              circuit design but also validated my capacity to translate theory
              into real-world solutions.

            <h1>Data Corruption Test Tool</h1>
            <h2>
              During my last internship at Other World Computing, I embarked on
              an exciting project where I developed a low-level data corruption
              testing tool. This tool was designed to read memory from a hard
              drive using C++ and perform hex dumping of the values. What set
              this project apart was its ability to run comparison operations,
              effectively detecting data corruption at the driver level in RAID
              systems. It was a challenging yet incredibly rewarding endeavor
              that allowed me to hone my programming skills and delve deep into
              the intricacies of storage systems, ensuring data integrity and
              reliability at a fundamental level.
